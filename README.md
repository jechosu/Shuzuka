My latest attempt at trying to use discord.js tutorials to make a JavaScript-based bot.

## Requirements:
-  Node.js
- Nodemon (optional)
- ffmpeg

## Installation:
- Use 'npm install' to install all packages and dependencies.
- Use the command line to get into the src folder, which will contain 'node.js'.
- Use 'node index.js' or 'nodemon index.js' to start the bot.
